Note that BTF has been disabled for SBF as of commit
559ff25f978a675230cc2dbcc18851424ace7fb9.

Moreover, we are tentatively going to completely remove BTF and related
support from SBF.

We have therefore removed the BTF/ and CORE/ test subdirectories which only
apply when BTF is available.

Once we determine for certain that BTF will definitely be removed, delete
this TODO-NOTE. If for some reason BTF is deemed necessary, re-instate the
test directories mentioned above.
